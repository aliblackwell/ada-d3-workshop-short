Hey! Here are the files we might look at during the Ada _Intro to D3_ workshop. We'll probably only manage to check out [lolli/01/](https://github.com/larsvers/ada-d3-workshop-short/tree/master/lolli/01) but you can peruse the rest and we might come back to this in January...

Just clone these files and kick them off with a locale server.

And please do hit me up if any questions at lars@datamake.io or [@lars_vers](https://twitter.com/@lars_vers)...
